		If your baby's left you, find a new place to dwell! We're right near the end
		of Lonely Programmer Street at the Hypertext Hotel. And with free Wi-Fi, it's the
		perfect place to camp out in front of your laptop and get some coding done.
		But if you're not a code monkey, have no fear:  we'll give you complete wireless
		access to all of your favorite social networking sites and more massively
		multi-player online role-playing games than actually exist in the universe!
		No laptop? No problem! Our business and recreation center includes nearly one
		thousand desktop computers with Windows Me and Internet Explorer 3, each tied to 
		the Internet by a dedicated 9600-baud modem.  But wait, did you say that you want
		to escape from computers during your vacation?  Well, OK, that doesn't make the
		least bit of sense (with so much great content on the Internet for your
		consumption), but we aim to please.  If you'd like, we can cut the power to your
		room, brick-over the windows and leave you completely in the dark for a sensory-
		deprivation experience that rivals the most expensive isolation tanks available!
		Act now, and we'll throw in a complete continental breakfast, absolutely free!
