		Save 50% on a complete Hairstyling Package!  At Cascading Style Salon and
		Day Spa, all of our stylists receive careful training and undergo a rigorous
		testing process to be certain that you'll be completely satisfied with your
		new haircut.  We begin your visit with a two hour interview, where our staff
		develops a solid understanding of your lifestyle, needs and desires, through
		a series of fifteen-hundred personal questions that delve deep into your psyche
		and uncover every detail of your habits, including hygeine, diet, exercise,
		career and relationship behaviors.  Next, you'll peruse a dozen catalogs, each
		containing over ten thousand photos of classic and modern hair styles, from
		which you can select up to six ideas for your new look.  Then, after a thorough
		washing, delousing, bleach and dye, we'll bleach and dye your hair once more
		for good measure before our plastic surgeon operates on your face, giving it
		the perfect structure for the style of your choice.  Then, and only then, our
		experienced stylist will cut your hair (adding and removing synthetic material
		as necessary) into the perfect style for you. Note:  please set aside a minimum
		of three days for your appointment, which must be scheduled at least three
		months in advance.  Subject to availability, we reserve the right to substitute
		a cake decorator for our plastic surgeon and Pablo Picasso for one of our
		trained stylists, as necessary.
