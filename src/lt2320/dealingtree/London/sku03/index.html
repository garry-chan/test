		Hit the road in the driver's seat of one of our luxury vehicles 
		for an extra day on us!  The extensive fleet at Web Wheels Auto Palace 
		includes a vehicle for every purpose from running around town to traversing
		the country, and a size for every client from the solo business traveler to
		the extended family... including the grandparents!  All of our vehicles are
		completely refurbished between rentals, including all-new interior fabrics,
		entirely new paint jobs, replacement body panels where necessary, new tires
		and a complete engine rehaul!  No matter what the odometer reads, you'll feel
		like you're driving a brand new car, because you practically are!  On top of
		it all, we precede each rental with a ten-thousand point safety check:  all
		belts and hoses are removed, stressed tested and re-installed; brakes are 
		completely removed, measured and reinstalled; fluids are drained, filtered, 
		refilled and topped-off; seat belts are tighetened and stress-tested with real
		live crash test dummies; and all windows are resealed to reduce driving noise
		and prevent unwanted pop-outs.  What other rental car company can make such
		a promise?  Nobody, that's who!  So rent from us, please, because this overkill
		is really wiping us out, and we desperately need your money!
