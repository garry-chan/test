		Environmental awareness has never been a better bargain! Accessorize your home 
		or office with decor and other great products made from 100% recycled materials.
		All of our items begin as other products, which our collection crews gather from
		demolitions, commercial dumpsters and curbside trash piles.  These perfectly-
		good discards are then shipped to our factories where they are melted down
		(all toxins are carefully expelled into the deep ocean or the ozone layer, as
		appropriate, so as not to degrade the air and water quality in the vicinity of
		our exectutive offices), poured into molds, hand- carved, hand- painted, hand-
		packaged and hand- delivered to our warehouse, where they are stockpiled until
		purchased or they go out of style.  In the latter case, they begin the process
		anew; in fact, nearly eighty percent of our current merchandise has been through
		our reclamation process at least two times (or sometimes as many as a dozen
		times) before.  So buy now, knowing that with every purchase, you might be
		helping the environment even more!
