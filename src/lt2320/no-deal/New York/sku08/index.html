		Get off your seat and get in shape for next year's swimsuit season!
		Act now and receive a full two-year membership to the gym for a fraction of
		the normal price.  Nowhere gives you a safer workout than our gym, free of the
		distractions of lost tourists, rabid animals and flash floods that are commonly
		encountered when exercising outdoors.  We promote a fit and healthy lifestyle
		through personal training, weightlifting, cardio equipment and group fitness
		classes.  Our gigantic equipment room is twenty times as big as our five
		Olympic-sized swimming pools combined, and a single lap around our indoor running
		track is the equivalent of a half-marathon!  Whether you prefer a climber,
		treadmill, rower, medicine ball, kettle bells or balance board, we have what you
		need to knock off calories and add definition to every muscle in your body. Our
		classes include aerobics, cross-training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, dance,
		body sculpting, ceramics, finger painting, cooking, project management, web
		development, race car driving and electrical engineering.  So what are you
		waiting for?  Earn a masters degree and black belt at the same time at Web
		Workers Workouts, the only ivy-league gym in town!
